This is still a new repository, so don't expect much to work until this note is
removed...

Overview
--------

This repository hosts a few modules and scripts that make it easier to
integrate Zendesk and Basecamp.

In our particular use-case we have customer requests (bugs, features, support)
coming into our support helpdesk (Zendesk) and we require those requests to be
turned into Basecamp todo's for our product and engineering teams to handle.
